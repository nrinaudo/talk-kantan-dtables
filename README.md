Decision tables are a form of specifications that can be explained in a couple of minutes. I've been toying with them for a bit, and
have started [kantan.dtables] as a result.

The purpose of this talk is to introduce [kantan.dtables] and, hopefully, muster interest in the project and motivate me to turn it into something
useful.

Slides can be consulted directly on the [companion site](https://nrinaudo.github.io/talk-kantan-dtables/#1).
